This package provides the following:

Provide thumbnails for documents
--------------------------------

As a default the mimetype icon will be served.
If the document mimetype is a known one,
a proper preview of the document will be generated.

The preview url can be get by calling @@document_preview/get_preview_url
on any context.
This can return either a fallback icon url
(the one provided by the mimetype registry, at the moment)
or a preview generated by the document conversion machinery.

The preview image data (if present)
can be retrieved by calling @@document_preview/get_preview_image
on any context.

So if you want to include the preview in your templates
you should do something like this::

    <img src="" tal:attributes="src obj/@@document_preview/get_preview_url" />
